# Thought 

I am delighted to announce the successful conclusion of a three-month #WeatherHackathon, where we secured the second place and received the Sustainable Excellence Award. I'm immensely grateful to WeatherRisk 天氣風險管理開發公司 for organizing this event and to ChiMing Peng for introducing me to it during our class. This opportunity allowed me to collaborate with peers from various fields in the hackathon.

Throughout the competition, I took on the role of a #softwaredeveloper, working to turn our creative ideas into a user-friendly product that aligns with #sustainability and #opensourcesoftware values. Our product, named "Hey! How's That Monster Growing so Big?", aims to promote individual environmental responsibility. To achieve this, we designed a LINE Bot integrated with #machinelearning-based image recognition technology for waste sorting. The bot features a monster growth system, encouraging users to engage in eco-friendly practices. I'll be sharing the link to my GitHub repo and the LINE BOT in my post, inviting everyone to join in. I plan to continuously update and enhance this service, ensuring the concept of sustainability becomes an integral part of everyone's lives.

Lastly, a big thank you to the "Weather Hackathon Shakespeare" team for the opportunity to collaborate and achieve remarkable results together!
